/*
In this challenge you will create a web page that presents a styled list of characters obtained from an API. Being able to render out data to a web page is a large part of what JavaScript developers do, this challenge assesses your ability to achieve such a task.

- [ ] Use the endpoint `[GET] https://swapi.dev/api/people` (mocked in [msw](https://github.com/mswjs/msw)) to obtain characters.
- [ ] Set the list of characters into state.
- [ ] Render your characters to the DOM:

  1. Build a React component named 'Character' to render an individual character.
  1. Map over the list in state, and for each character render a Character to the page.
  1. Each rendered character must display its name in the DOM (e.g. "Luke Skywalker").
  1. The character's name can't be hard-coded into the HTML. This data must be obtained from the API.
  1. The components must be styled with **styled-components**.

  - Data obtained from the endpoint using browser-run JavaScript is mocked with [msw](https://github.com/mswjs/msw).
- If you test the endpoint using HTTPie or Postman you will obtain different results, as msw won't intercept the request.
- You are welcome to create additional files but **do not move or rename existing files** or folders.
- Do not alter your `package.json` file except to install extra libraries.
- The `start` process can sometimes choke after adding new dependencies and may need to be restarted.
- In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results.
- Schedule time to review and polish your work, including spell-checking and grammar-checking.
- It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.
